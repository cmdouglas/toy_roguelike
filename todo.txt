Bugs
 - Make smoothwalls update their glyphs correctly (sort of working)
 - Goblins don't seem to open doors (they should)

Refactoring:
 - implement subscriber/subject for the game console (at least). Try not to make a huge mess.
   - have all actions return an event which knows whether and how to report itself on the console.
 - Travel logic should exist in the command, not in the action

Features:
