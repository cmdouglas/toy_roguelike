Bugs
 - Goblins don't seem to open doors (they should)

Refactoring:
 - implement subscriber/subject for the game console (at least). Try not to make a huge mess.
   - have all actions return an event which knows whether and how to report itself on the console.
 - I don't like how entities contain lots of info/logic on how to draw themselves to a terminal.  This
   should maybe live on an EntityView class under UI?  Same for events.
 - AI needs some tidying up.


Features:
