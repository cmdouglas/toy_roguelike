Refactoring:
 - separation of world logic and display logic:
   - info about glyphs/colors can be moved out of entities and into some sort of entityview class in
     ui.terminal.display
   - event descriptions can go there too, or into an external data file.  yaml?
   - maybe some entity info too?
   - this means i can get rid of ui.colors and ui.glyphs, or move them under terminal where they belong
   
Features:
 UI
  - windowed menus
 Functionality
  - Game Over:
    - Score/leaderboard
    - winning condition
  - Save/Load
    - pickling is easy, but not great for sharing save files or supporting old versions
    - json:
      - will need to serialize all of the savable state
      - and decide what needs to be saved
      -
  - projectiles/targeting mode/shooting things/pew pew
  - more than one map
  - xp, levelling, skills, ~progression~

 Fun
   - moar content
     - more monsters
     - weapons/armour
     - spells
     - materials?

   - More than one board (stairs/portals)

   - themed areas

Pipedreams:
 - Tiles (pyglet?  kivy?)
