Refactoring:
 - event publish/subscribe system so that all my entities can react to one another cleanly
   - refactor ai using events.
     - in particular, now they can react better to the player entering their los, etc
   - make log/notifications part of the world (so that it can be saved, and various things can write to it)
   - make 'tick' just inform the UI of whether it should redraw or not, rather than telling it everything that happened

 - reasonable combat model
